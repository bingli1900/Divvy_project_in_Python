Since many cities are now developing bike sharing systems (for example, the Divvy bike at Chicago now has 500 stations), I'm going to use these data to investigate and assess the urban planning of a city. More specificly, since the bike system shows the bike flow pattern at any particular time of a day, we can cluster stations sharing the same pattern and do a segmentation of the city, hopefully we can recognize the regions with different functioning, like business, education, tourism, resident, catering and so on. The basic ideas behind this would be, first, a particular functioning area would have a specific pattern, second, there would be large flows across different functioning areas rather than within a particular region during rush hours. 

The dataset I'm using is from divvy website, one is data for trips which has the information for each trip, like from_station_id, to_station_id, starttime, finishtime, name_of_user, gender and so on. And another data file is about stations, telling us the location and capacity of each station using station_id as a key.

In the first plot I showed a preliminary result of clustering. I generated a vector for each station, in which each component stands for the inflow or outflow within each hour of a day. And I treat workdays and weekends as different, so the total dimension of this vector is about 80. And the clustering is done by PCA and K-means. Later I added location information into the vector to make adjacent points more likely to be classified into the same class. In this plot, the x axis is longitude and y axis stands for latitude. Each point is a station. We can easily see some interesting patterns from this plot. The purple part should be residential area. Dark green and light green is the CBD at the center of downtown Chicago. We can recognize University of chicago in the southern. And the orange regions are probably those with low utility. Another interesting fact is that we find some important tourism resorts by the lake are also recognized and painted dark blue. In the second plot, I'm showing the inflow pattern of each station during the morning rush hours (7:00 am to 10:00 am).
